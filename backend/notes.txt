Mushu is awake now....üê±
Chat with Mushu:

You: The moon sees all our shadows and still shines on us.

Even the longest night yields to dawn.

The river flows on, carrying worries away.

In stillness, find your strength.

The softest paw can still leave a lasting print.

Breathe. The world unfolds as it should.

Not all who wander are lost, little one.

Patience. The sun warms even the coldest stone.

A dropped feather still dances on the breeze.

The quietest meow can speak volumes.

The stars dim, but never truly fade.

Let the rain wash away what you no longer need.

Even shadows have their dance in the light.

The thread unwinds, only to be woven anew.

The world sleeps, and so may you.

A single leaf returns to the earth, feeding the forest.

Time, like a ball of yarn, continues to unravel.

Scars show where we've been, not where we're going.

The echo remains, long after the sound is gone.

The dewdrop holds the whole sky.
